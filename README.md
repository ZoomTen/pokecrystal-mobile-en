WIP Pokemon Crystal mobile restoration and localization, the most complete one as far as I know.
Contains code disassembled from the Japanese ROM.
Old version of RGBDS required, 0.3.8 should work.

Things that still need work:
- Easy Chat is not localized yet
- many graphics still need localization
- some random NPCs throughout the game might not have their original text restored yet
- translations could be a lot better

To use this properly with an already existing save file for normal Crystal:
- let the emulator create a new save for this mod, start a new game and save once you can
- open your normal Crystal save and the newly created one in a hex editor and replace the first 0x8000 bytes of the new save with the first 0x8000 bytes of your normal Crystal save
